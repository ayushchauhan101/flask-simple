## Create a form and render the input using POST request:

- Create a form with 'post' method

- Mention GET and POST methods in app.py

- Request.form to get the form input data using POST request

### Render separate html page depending upon the request methods 

The request methods accepted are 'GET' and 'POST'
The form is explicitly commanded to send POST request, hence the flask server renders the greet.html page.
